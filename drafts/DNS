## BIND is not everything there is
BIND is not the only DNS server out there. You might want to also consider using [NSD][1] and [Unbound][2].
Same goes for DNS tools, ldnsutils package contains drill which is similar to dig.
And more over, NSD and Unbound both should be performing better than BIND.

[RFC1912][3] provides a good read on most common errors in DNS configuration
